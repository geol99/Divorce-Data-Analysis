```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
divorce = read.csv("divorce_data.csv", header = T, sep = ";")
colnames(divorce)
```

```{r}
X = divorce[,-55] #survey questions and answers
Y = divorce[,55] #divorce (1) or not (0)

#is our data well-balanced?
table(Y)
```

Our data seems pretty balanced, so our classification model shouldn't be biased.

```{r}
dim(divorce)
```

```{r}
#checking for missing data
anyNA(divorce)
```

```{r}
#determining highly correlated features
library(caret)
findCorrelation(cor(X), 0.80, names = TRUE)
```

```{r}
